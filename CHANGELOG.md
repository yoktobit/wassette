## [v0.3.4] - 2025-11-02

### Added

- Component registry validation pipeline that automatically validates new or modified component URIs in `component-registry.json` on pull requests, ensuring all URIs can be successfully loaded by wassette before merging changes ([#456](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/456))
- Memory server example (`examples/memory-js`) demonstrating a knowledge graph storage system as a WebAssembly component, migrated from the MCP memory server with in-memory persistence, supporting entity and relation management, observations, and full-text search capabilities ([#437](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/437))
- arXiv research component (`examples/arxiv-rs`) in Rust that provides three functions: `search-papers` for searching arXiv with query, max results, date, and category filters; `download-paper` for downloading PDF files; and `read-paper` for fetching paper metadata and abstracts. The component uses the arXiv API and returns formatted markdown output ([#436](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/436))

- Added `wassette inspect` subcommand for debugging WebAssembly components, displaying their JSON schema for inputs and outputs. This provides a convenient way to inspect component metadata without loading them into the MCP server ([#430](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/430))
- Added `wassette registry` CLI subcommands for searching and fetching components from the registry defined in `component-registry.json`. New commands include `wassette registry search [query]` to search for components by name or description, and `wassette registry get <component>` to fetch and load components directly from the registry
- Added `just install` command for convenient local installation to ~/.local/bin ([#449](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/449))
- Configurable bind address for HTTP-based transports (SSE and StreamableHttp) via CLI flag `--bind-address`, environment variable `WASSETTE_BIND_ADDRESS`, or configuration file field `bind_address`. Default remains `127.0.0.1:9001` for backward compatibility ([#445](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/445))

- Automated CHANGELOG synchronization with release pipeline: Release workflow extracts changelog content for release notes and automatically updates CHANGELOG.md post-release. Implemented using Python scripts with unit tests. The update-changelog job now checks that the release job succeeded before running. ([#404](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/404))

- Added `--disable-builtin-tools` flag to the `serve` command that allows disabling all built-in tools (load-component, unload-component, list-components, get-policy, grant/revoke permissions, search-components, reset-permission). When enabled, only loaded component tools will be available through the MCP server ([#374](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/374))
