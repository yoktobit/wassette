## Why Wassette?

- **Convenience**: Wassette makes it easy to extend AI agents with new tools,
  all without ever having to leave the chat window.
- **Reusability**: Wasm Components are generic and reusable;
  there is nothing MCP-specific about them.
- **Security**: Wassette is built on the Wasmtime security sandbox, providing
  browser-grade isolation of tools.

## Architecture

## Installation

**Quick start:** For Linux/macOS, use our one-liner install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/wassette/main/install.sh | bash
```

**For complete installation instructions** for all platforms (including Windows, Homebrew, Nix, Docker, and more), see our **[Installation Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/wassette/latest/installation.html)**.

## Using Wassette

With Wassette installed, the next step is to register it with your agent of choice. See our [Quick Start] guide (3 simple steps), or check the [MCP Clients guide](https://microsoft.github.io/wassette/latest/mcp-clients.html) for detailed setup instructions for GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI.

Once configured, you can start loading WebAssembly components. To teach your agent to tell the time, ask it to load a time component:

```text
Please load the time component from oci://ghcr.io/microsoft/time-server-js:latest
```

Now that the time component is loaded, we can ask your agent to tell you the current time:

```text
What is the current time?
```

The agent will respond with the current time, which is fetched from the time component running in a secure WebAssembly sandbox:

```output
The current time July 31, 2025 at 10:30 AM UTC
```

Congratulations! You've just run your first Wasm Component and taught your agent how to tell time!

## Registry authentication

Wassette will attempt to reuse existing OCI registry login credentials rather
than requiring you to store passwords in the Wassette configuration. The
precedence is:

- **Explicit credentials**: any `registry_credentials` provided in the
  `LifecycleConfig` remain the highest priority.
- **Credential helpers / `credsStore`**: Wassette consults Docker/Podman
  configuration (`DOCKER_CONFIG` or `~/.docker/config.json`) and will invoke
  the configured credential helper (e.g. `docker-credential-<name>`) to
  retrieve credentials for a given registry. This supports both per-registry
  `credHelpers` and a global `credsStore` setting.
- **Raw `auth` entries (opt-in)**: Wassette will only decode and use the
  base64 `auth` fields found under `auths` in `config.json` when the
  environment variable `WASSETTE_ALLOW_INSECURE_DOCKER_AUTH` is set to
  `1` or `true`. This fallback is intentionally gated because many systems
  use credential helpers or external stores; reading raw `auth` entries can
  leak secrets or bypass external credential management.

Notes:

- Wassette looks for helper binaries named `docker-credential-<name>` and
  will attempt common suffixes on Windows (e.g. `.cmd`, `.exe`). Helpers are
  invoked with the `get` subcommand and the registry hostname on stdin and
  must return JSON with `Username`/`username` and `Secret`/`secret` (or
  `Password`/`password`).
- If you rely on external credential stores (e.g. Docker credential
  helpers or Podman's auth), prefer configuring them rather than enabling
  `WASSETTE_ALLOW_INSECURE_DOCKER_AUTH`.
- Example (enable unsafe fallback):

```powershell
setx WASSETTE_ALLOW_INSECURE_DOCKER_AUTH 1
```
